# RimworldTradeMod
 
Description

I always found the original trade UI frustrating. It is difficult to find what items I want to sell among the huge list of junk the trader has. What do negative vs positive numbers mean? Why is the cost of the trade so far away from the accept/cancel buttons?

This mod reorganizes the trade UI into a two-column layout to make it clear what items the colony has vs trader has, who is trading, and how much it will cost.

Save games and compatibility

This mod merely changes the UI. This is compatible with adding/removing from saved games.

Multiplayer compatibility

This mod supports the RimWorld Multiplayer mod.

Future plans

If I do continue to add to this mod, some ideas are:
*Add alternate view that has colony vs trader in separate tabs
*Add button to UI that maxes out the amount that can be sold/bought given the colony's/trader's current amount of money (no more fiddling with finding the perfect amount of Cloth to sell to make the trader broke)
*Re-color "Reset", "Cancel", "Accept" buttons for clarity (Cancel = red, Accept = green)

I welcome any ideas to improve the current UI!
